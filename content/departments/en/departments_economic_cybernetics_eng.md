The chair of the department is dr. hab. oec., associate professor Gigla O.
Chitaya.

The department has a long history. It was established in 1967 as the Department
of Mathematical Methods and Programming. In 1986, it merged with the Department
of Information Sciences and Computer Engineering and 5 years later the merger was
given the name of the Department of Economic Cybernetics was organized. In 1992
its name was substituted by that of Applied Mathematics and Economic Cybernetics.
At present the department comprises highly qualified specialists (professors and
associate professors constitute 71%) guided by the motto “Via Mathematical Models
to Systems Researches of Economy”.

The department takes a key position in training specialists majoring in 1-
31 03 06 «Economic Cybernetics» with the specialization “Optimal Planning
and Management in Economy”. Its graduates are given the qualification of a
cyberneticist-economist.

The department provides delivering a number of courses such as Higher
Mathematics, Mathematical Programming, Probability Theory and Mathematical
Statistics, Economic Cybernetics, Econometrics, Applied Orthogonal Methods in
Economy, Economic and Mathematical Methods and Models, Operational Analysis,
Mathematical Models in Microeconomics, Optimum Planning Models and Business
Games in Finance, Modeling of Financial Risks in Banking etc.
Training students majoring in Economic Cybernetics is based on three sets
of courses – mathematics, economics, and computer technologies and systems. It
results in students’ thorough knowledge of computer information technologies,
methods of PC-based economic and mathematical modeling and skills to design
management decision support systems, conduct planning, analytical, managerial and
practical activities in every branches of economy. They are employed by state and
regional bodies of governance, banks, auditing companies, investment and insurance
companies, research institutes and institutions of education. And the demand for such
specialists is constantly growing.

The department faculty stimulates its students to participate in research projects
who present their works at national and international contests of students' research
papers. There are a number of laureates or winners in various nominations, including
the special Scholarship of the President and Government of the Republic of Belarus.
Those of them who are further interested in science and research can develop their
interests at the post-graduate courses: master or PhD programs.

The department’s main directions of scholarly research:
------------------------------------------------------

-	modeling of enterprise sectoral structure
